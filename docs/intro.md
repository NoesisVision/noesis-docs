# Welcome to Noesis

**Noesis** is an intelligent code architecture documentation platform that helps you understand, visualize, and document your IT systems automatically.

## What is Noesis?

Noesis automates the process of understanding system architecture through deterministic static analysis combined with AI-enhanced descriptions. It creates precise system maps without AI first, providing a solid foundation that allows you to use AI intelligently and efficiently only where it adds real value - giving you full control over costs and quality.

:::info Current Support
Noesis currently supports analysis of **.NET repositories**. Support for additional programming languages and frameworks is planned for future releases.
:::

## How It Works

Noesis automates the process of understanding system architecture in four simple steps:

### 1. [Select your repositories](/docs/setup) 📁
Point Noesis to your .NET codebase you want to explore.

### 2. [Define conventions with DSL](/docs/configure) 🔧
Specify your architectural rules and conventions in a lightweight domain-specific language.

### 3. [Run deterministic static analysis](/docs/configure) 🔍
Noesis scans the code using static analysis and generates a repeatable map of the system's essential building blocks.

### 4. [Use the map in multiple ways](/docs/explore) 🚀
Navigate, document, and integrate with AI for comprehensive system understanding.

## Multiple Ways to Use Your System Map

### Noesis UI
Navigate interactively through AI-described modules, entry points, and key components to visually explore their connections and analyze your system.

### Documentation
Export Noesis map content to clear, static documentation - share it with clients or integrate with your internal wiki for comprehensive system overview wherever you need it.

### AI Integration (MCP)
*Coming soon* - Expose the map or documentation to AI agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP) for more meaningful, context-aware conversations.
